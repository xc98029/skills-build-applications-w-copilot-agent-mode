## Step 3: Initialize and create the octofit_db MongoDB database, update Django project/app files, and populate the MongoDB database

In this step, we will will accomplish the following:

- Setup the octofig_db mongoDB database structure.
- Update the octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker app files.
  - settings, models, serializers, urls, views, tests, admins files.
- Populate the octofit_db database with test data.
- Verify the test data is populated in the octofit_db database.

1. Open all files in the `docs` folder and keep this file open in the editor.
2. Click the GitHub Copilot Chat click the :paperclip: and add "Open Editors" to the prompt.
3. Copy and paste the following prompt in the GitHub Copilot Chat and select the "Agent" instead of "Ask" or "Edit" from the drop down where you are inserting the prompt.

>[!NOTE]
> Do not change the model from GPT-4o this will be an optional activity at the end of the course.
> Keep in mind that the Copilot agent mode is conversational so it may ask you questions and you can ask it questions too.
> Wait a moment for the Copilot to respond and press the continue button to execute commands presented by Copilot agent mode.
> Keep files created and updated by Copilot agent mode until it is finished.
> Agent mode has the ability to evaluate your code base and execute commands and add/refactor/delete parts of your code base and automatically self heal if it or you makes a mistake in the process.

> 1. Initialize the mongo octofit_db database.
> 2. Create a correct table structure for users, teams, activity, leaderboard, and workouts collections.
> 3. Make sure there is a unique id for primary key for the user collection.
>   ex. db.users.createIndex({ "email": 1 }, { unique: true })
> 4. Execute the command for me to create the database.
> 5. List the collections in the octofit_db database.

### :keyboard: Activity: populate the octofit_db database with test data from Django project/app files

> **Prompt**
>
> ```prompt
> Based on the example monafit tracker app in the docs/mona-high-school-fitness-tracker.md file and use octofit as the name for mergington's high schools app. > Let's populate the octofit_db database with test data. Use same data from docs/mona-high-school-fitness-tracker.md file.
> 
> 1. Create a test data file in the octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker directory.
> 2. Run makemigrations and migrate the database in a Python virtual environment.
> 3. Populate the octofit_db database with test data for users, teams, activities, leaderboard, and workouts collections based on test data in docs/mona-high-school-fitness-tracker.md populate_db.py.

## Next step

Now that the Django project backend setup and the database is populated, let's continue on to the next step [Step 4: Setup Django REST Framework](./4-setup-django-rest-framework.md)
